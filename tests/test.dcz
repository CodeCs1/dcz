    There are [5] data type, there includes:
        char
        int
        short
        long
        unsigned
        suu (a.k.a Real number)
        float

    Total Duca Compile Script Keywords:
        func
        if
        else
        for
        foreach
        while
        class
        export
        [data types]
    
    Example code:
        export unsigned char TRUE = 1;
        export unsigned char FALSE = 0;

    func _start() {
        Lprint "hello world";
        char t = 'a';
    }

    About variable thing.
    assign using significant data type just like C
    e.g:
        char* a = 3;
        t(a); #This function only allow int data type

    [About suu data type]
    * A little note:
        When the compiler detected a variable that using suu as data type, it will show a warning.
            test.dcz:1:1: warning: variable 'abcxyz' is using suu data type, which is unstable. Consider to use float instead.
    * Also, please do not feed any data that not number to 'suu' data type
    e.g:
        suu g = "!??"; 
        # Sometime it will throw this error message:
        #    Get that trash outta my face. I've seen too much!
        
    and some basic calculation
        suu t = 1 + 1; # -> 11
        suu t = 1 - 1; # -> 11
        suu t = 1 * 1; # -> 11
        suu t = 1/1; # -> 11
        suu t = 1/0; # -> 10 Yes, this can perform division by 0 too!
        to avoid it, simply cover into partheness
        eg: suu t = (1+1); # -> 2
    and empty one.
        suu empty;
        # This message will only show when verbose is enabled.
        # [Suu]: I still haven't singled out a number to date! >~<

    about list:
        list p = [1,2,3,4];
        p[0];
        Call()[0]; call from function.
        func main {
            ret [1,2,3,4];
        }[0]; NOT allowed this shit.

int a = 3;
a+1;
